# Instructions to Complete SwiftUI Branch Setup

## Current Status
✅ The `swiftui` branch has been successfully created locally with commit `a1ec65c`
✅ All necessary code changes have been made and verified
✅ The branch removes CoreData and keeps only SwiftUI storage

## Manual Step Required
Since I cannot directly push branches other than the PR branch, the repository owner needs to push the swiftui branch to the remote repository.

## Option 1: Push from the PR Branch (Recommended if you have access to this environment)
If you can access the current working directory where the changes were made:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Audiometry/Audiometry
git checkout swiftui
git push origin swiftui
```

## Option 2: Recreate the Branch Locally (If the above environment is not accessible)
If you need to recreate the branch from your local machine:

1. Clone or update your local repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perez987/Audiometry.git
   cd Audiometry
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Create the swiftui branch from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b swiftui
   ```

3. Apply the changes (you can get them from the PR commit 5020f75):
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick 5020f75
   ```

4. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin swiftui
   ```

## Option 3: Use GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/perez987/Audiometry
2. Click on the branch dropdown
3. Create a new branch called "swiftui" from the main branch
4. Manually apply the changes from the PR or merge the changes

## Changes Summary
The swiftui branch includes:
- ✅ Removed StorageMode.swift
- ✅ Removed CoreData files (ContentView, Patient, PersistenceController, PatientNavigationView)
- ✅ Removed DataModel.xcdatamodeld directory
- ✅ Renamed ContentViewSwiftUI.swift → ContentView.swift
- ✅ Renamed PatientNavigationViewSwiftUI.swift → PatientNavigationView.swift
- ✅ Updated AudiometryApp.swift to use only SwiftUI storage
- ✅ Updated README.md to document SwiftUI-only storage
- ✅ Removed storage mode strings from localizations

## Files in SwiftUI Branch
After the changes, the swiftui branch contains only these Swift files:
- AppDelegate.swift
- AudiometryApp.swift
- AudiometryCalculations.swift
- ContentView.swift (SwiftUI version)
- LanguageManager.swift
- PatientData.swift
- PatientDataStore.swift
- PatientNavigationView.swift (SwiftUI version)

## Verification
After pushing the swiftui branch, verify it by:
```bash
git checkout swiftui
find Audiometry -name "*.swift" | sort
# Should show only the 8 files listed above
```
