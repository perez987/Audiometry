## App for macOS 13+

While this is a valid app for everyday use, it's more of an exercise in learning SwiftUI and persistent data storage. Think of it as a way to practice SwiftUI with a functional app that you can modify to your liking.

## Summary

- Xcode 15.2 project
- App runs on macOS13+
- Features:
  - patient data entry
  - audiometric test input
  - hearing loss assessment calculations
  - including SAL and ELI indices with results display
  - save patients data in core data as SQLite database
  - language system with English and Spanish
  - buttons to move back and forth between saved patients
  - search button
  - print report of current patient. 

## CoreData storage implementation
  
This branch uses CoreData storage with SQLite database for patient data persistence. Patient data are saved in:

`/Users/<user_name>/Library/Containers/perez987.Audiometry/Data/Library/Application Support/Audiometry/DataModel.sqlite`

You can bring your saved data by copying this file (SQLite database) to a different machine and running the Audiometry app on it.

> **Note**: For a version with dual storage (CoreData and SwiftUI) that allows switching between both, see the `main` branch. For a SwiftUI-only version, see the `swiftui` branch.
